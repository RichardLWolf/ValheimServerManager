This app automates the launching and monitoring of one or more Valhiem dedicated servers.  It will also install the necessary SteamCmd.exe program 
and game files from Steam to start the server.

The app can stop the game server once per day at at time of your choosing for an automated backup (ZIP archive) of the world data files and/or update 
the game program files at the same time.  Currently the app keeps the most recent 20 backup files, this is not configurable at this time.

# Requirements
