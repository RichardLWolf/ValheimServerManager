# Install Files
Just extract the files into a folder or the same folder where you wish to have the server located.  Note that the program **requires the .NET Framework 4.6.2 or higher but does not supply it.**
Also note that the program does not mess with your router, you will still be responsible for port-forwarding the desired game ports through your own firewall.

# Running The Program
You can start the main EXE directly, or add it to your Windows startup so it launches on reboot.  The program does not have to be run as Admin, but if you want it to add firewall entries during installation then you should "Run As Administrator" during that time.

# Using The Program
The tool buttons are pretty much self-explanitory, hover over the button for a tool-tip.  

Left-clicking on a server entry will select it and show you how long until reboot (not a "live" or running update, just at the point you clicked it) if it's running.
Right-clicking on a server will give you the option to perform a Steam query if the server is running.
